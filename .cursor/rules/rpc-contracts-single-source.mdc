# RPC Contracts Single Source of Truth

- Do NOT create or duplicate RPC Contracts (interfaces/DTOs/attributes) under `/server`.
- All contracts live ONLY in `Packages/com.bruce.rpc.contracts/`.
- Server projects must include contracts by linking sources:
  - `<Compile Include="..\..\Packages\com.bruce.rpc.contracts\**\*.cs" />`
- If a server change requires a contract update, modify the shared contract files in the package, not by re-creating them in server.
